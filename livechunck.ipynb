      "3. Future-Proof Curriculum: Skills and Ethics for the AI Era\n",
      "Why it Matters: To stay relevant, education content itself must evolve. We need to teach for the\n",
      "future, not the past. This means emphasizing skills, knowledge, and mindsets that will serve\n",
      "students in an AI-saturated world. Two categories stand out: (a) skills where humans have an\n",
      "edge or that complement AI, and (b) education about AI itself (its use, its impact, and ethics).\n",
      "Key Elements of Future-Proof Curriculum:\n",
      "-------------------------------------\n",
      "AI Literacy: Every student should graduate with a basic understanding of what AI is,\n",
      "how it works at a conceptual level (e.g., machine learning needs data, can have biases,\n",
      "etc.), and how it impacts society. This is akin to computer literacy or digital literacy being\n",
      "essential today. It demystifies AI and enables informed citizens. For example, the U.S.\n",
      "Department of Education suggests that understanding AI is critical for crafting effective\n",
      "policies and using AI responsibly​ AI literacy also means knowing the limitations of AI –\n",
      "that it can make mistakes or reflect biases from its training data – so that people are not\n",
      "over-reliant or naively trusting of AI outputs.\n",
      "-------------------------------------\n",
      "Ethics and Digital Citizenship: Incorporate lessons on data privacy, AI ethics (like\n",
      "fairness and transparency), and digital responsibility. Students should grapple with\n",
      "questions like “How should we treat AI entities?” or “When is it appropriate to use an\n",
      "AI’s recommendation versus human judgment?” so that they are ready to face these\n",
      "dilemmas in real life.\n",
      "●​ Core Human Skills: Emphasize creativity, critical thinking, problem-solving,\n",
      "communication, collaboration, and emotional intelligence. These are frequently cited as\n",
      "skills AI can’t easily replace. For example, while an AI might generate a business\n",
      "report, a human with critical thinking skills is needed to ask the right questions for the AI\n",
      "-------------------------------------\n",
      "to investigate, and a human leader with emotional intelligence is needed to manage team\n",
      "dynamics and morale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Metacognitive Skills: Teach students how to learn. In a world where knowledge is\n",
      "abundant and ever-changing, the most important skill may be the ability to acquire new\n",
      "skills efficiently. This includes strategies for self-directed learning, online research,\n",
      "skepticism and source evaluation (to avoid misinformation), and adapting to new\n",
      "interfaces or tools. As noted earlier, the top skills for 2025 emphasized self-management\n",
      "like active learning strategies​. Instilling a habit of lifelong learning is key – e.g., requiring\n",
      "students to periodically do mini-projects on topics they have to teach themselves.\n",
      "-------------------------------------\n",
      "Interdisciplinary Systems Thinking: AI-related challenges (like autonomous vehicles\n",
      "on city streets, or algorithmic decisions in justice) are complex systems problems.\n",
      "Students should learn to connect dots across disciplines – a skill called systems thinking.\n",
      "They should be comfortable working with concepts from technology, economics, social\n",
      "science, and ecology together. This might be taught through case studies (e.g., study the\n",
      "entire food supply chain and identify where AI could help or harm).\n",
      "●​ Global and Cultural Awareness: AI is global, and so are the challenges like climate\n",
      "change that will persist. Education should foster global citizenship – understanding\n",
      "different cultures, working in diverse teams (perhaps remotely via digital tools), and\n",
      "-------------------------------------\n",
      "awareness of global issues. AI might amplify either global cooperation or conflict, and\n",
      "educated individuals must strive for the former. Cross-cultural communication and\n",
      "languages remain valuable, even if AI translators exist – because understanding culture is\n",
      "deeper than just language translation.​\n",
      "-------------------------------------\n",
      "Strategies for Implementation:\n",
      "Update Standards and Exams: Education boards should update learning standards to\n",
      "include AI-related competencies and the above skills. If important exams (university\n",
      "entrance, etc.) include sections on problem-solving or ethical reasoning, schools will\n",
      "teach it. For instance, including a prompt about AI ethics in a standardized test essay\n",
      "could incentivize schools to discuss it in class.\n",
      "●​ Teacher Training for New Content: Many current teachers may not feel equipped to\n",
      "teach about AI or may not be comfortable with less structured skill-based teaching. Invest\n",
      "in professional development to help teachers learn about AI tools and how to integrate\n",
      "them, and train them in coaching students in soft skills and project work. This could\n",
      "-------------------------------------\n",
      "include workshops, online certification courses (some nonprofits and companies already\n",
      "offer “teach AI” resources), and sharing of best practices via educator networks.\n",
      "●​ Curriculum Partnerships: Work with tech companies, universities, and NGOs to bring\n",
      "current expertise into schools. For example, an AI company might help co-develop a high\n",
      "school module on machine learning basics. An ethics institute might provide a curriculum\n",
      "on technology ethics. Public-private partnerships can ensure content is cutting-edge.\n",
      "However, maintain academic independence to avoid commercial bias; any partnership\n",
      "should be transparent and pedagogically sound.\n",
      "●​ Use AI as a Teaching Tool: Embrace AI in the classroom not just as content but as a tool\n",
      "-------------------------------------\n",
      "to enhance learning. For instance, generative AI (like advanced versions of GPT) can be\n",
      "-------------------------------------\n",
      "used by students to brainstorm ideas or get feedback on writing – but teach them to use it\n",
      "critically and verify its outputs. This both improves learning outcomes (AI as tutor) and\n",
      "builds their skill in leveraging AI effectively. In essence, the classroom becomes a\n",
      "microcosm of the future workplace, where humans and AI work together.\n",
      "●​ Capstone “Future” Projects: Consider requiring a capstone project where students must\n",
      "envision a future scenario involving AI and propose a solution or stance. For example, a\n",
      "senior project might be: “Envision the role of humans in a healthcare system largely run\n",
      "by AI in 2040, and design a plan for training doctors alongside AI.” This synthesizes\n",
      "knowledge, requires ethical and practical reasoning, and gets students thinking ahead.\n",
      "-------------------------------------\n",
      "Policy Support: National education policies can establish AI Education Task Forces​\n",
      "weforum.org\n",
      "to drive these curriculum changes at scale. Several countries have begun doing this (for example,\n",
      "some have national AI curricula at high school level, and UNESCO has an initiative for AI in\n",
      "education). Policy can also fund the creation of open educational resources on AI and future\n",
      "skills, so that even schools with limited budgets have access to quality materials. Furthermore,\n",
      "updating apprenticeship and vocational training frameworks to include digital and AI skills is\n",
      "important, so that not just college-bound students but all learners are future-ready.\n",
      "-------------------------------------\n",
      "4. Policy Recommendations for a Future-Ready Education System\n",
      "Policymakers hold a crucial lever in shaping how education adapts to AI. Bold, forward-thinking\n",
      "policies can catalyze the changes needed. Below are key policy recommendations to ensure\n",
      "education systems stay relevant and equitable in an AI-driven future:\n",
      "1.​ Establish National AI-Education Strategies: Governments should create\n",
      "comprehensive strategies that outline how to integrate AI into education both as a subject\n",
      "(curriculum content) and as a tool (supporting teaching and administration). This strategy\n",
      "should involve educators, AI experts, industry, and ethicists. It might include setting\n",
      "targets like “By 2030, all high school graduates will have completed a course in AI\n",
      "-------------------------------------\n",
      "fundamentals,” or “Provide AI-based personalized learning support to every student.”\n",
      "Countries like Singapore and China have already launched such initiatives, which others\n",
      "can learn from. International bodies (UNESCO, WEF, OECD) can facilitate knowledge\n",
      "sharing between nations​\n",
      "2.​ Create AI and Future Skills Task Forces: At the regional or local level, set up\n",
      "AI-focused task forces within education departments​\n",
      "These task forces can pilot new curricula, train teachers, and recommend agile\n",
      "adjustments as technology evolves. They ensure there’s a dedicated group thinking about\n",
      "the intersection of AI and education continually, not just in one-off reforms.\n",
      "3.​ Promote AI Literacy for All Citizens: Launch public education campaigns on AI\n",
      "-------------------------------------\n",
      "(similar to past campaigns on internet literacy). This can include free online courses (with\n",
      "certification incentives), community workshops, and museum exhibits about AI. It’s not\n",
      "-------------------------------------\n",
      "only students who need AI literacy – the general adult population, including parents and\n",
      "older workers, do too. This also helps generate public support for educational reforms if\n",
      "people understand why they’re needed.\n",
      "4.​ Invest in Infrastructure for Immersive and Digital Learning: Allocate funding for\n",
      "schools to acquire technology needed for immersive learning – such as VR/AR\n",
      "equipment, high-speed internet, and powerful computing for AI labs. At the same time,\n",
      "invest in basic digital infrastructure in under-resourced areas (rural or low-income\n",
      "communities) to ensure equity. The goal is to prevent a scenario where wealthy schools\n",
      "leap ahead with AI-enabled learning while others fall further behind.\n",
      "5.​ Mandate Continuous Curriculum Revision Cycles: Traditionally, curricula might be\n",
      "-------------------------------------\n",
      "updated every decade or so. That’s too slow now. Policies can require a review of\n",
      "curriculum every 2-3 years with respect to technological relevance. Perhaps create a\n",
      "modular curriculum structure that can be tweaked incrementally without overhauling\n",
      "everything (making it easier to incorporate, say, a new module on “AI and climate\n",
      "change” or remove outdated content).\n",
      "6.​ Integrate Lifelong Learning into the Education System: Policies should formalize the\n",
      "concept of lifelong learning. This could look like: education accounts or credits that\n",
      "citizens can use at any stage of life to take courses (a bit like continuing education units,\n",
      "but government-subsidized). Another approach is to support institutions like community\n",
      "-------------------------------------\n",
      "colleges or online platforms to offer flexible certification programs for those switching\n",
      "careers. For example, if 50% of employees need reskilling by 2025​, policy can\n",
      "incentivize employers to provide on-the-job training and partner with educational\n",
      "institutions (perhaps through tax credits or public grants for training programs).\n",
      "7.​ Support Educators Through the Transition: Teaching in the AI era will be challenging\n",
      "– educators need to master new tools and methodologies. Policies should ensure\n",
      "competitive salaries to attract and retain high-quality teachers in new subjects like AI.\n",
      "Provide funding for professional development and consider creating new roles (like\n",
      "“technology integration specialist” in schools) who can assist teachers. Also, involve\n",
      "-------------------------------------\n",
      "teacher unions and associations in shaping policies so that changes are realistic on the\n",
      "ground.\n",
      "8.​ Responsible AI Use Guidelines in Education: Governments should issue guidelines or\n",
      "regulations on the ethical use of AI in education​ For instance, protecting student data\n",
      "privacy if AI tools are collecting performance data, avoiding algorithmic bias in any\n",
      "AI-driven assessments or recommendation systems, and ensuring transparency (students\n",
      "and teachers should know if and how AI is affecting decisions like grading or tracking).\n",
      "Following UNESCO’s stance, always keep human oversight – AI should augment, not\n",
      "replace, human decision-making in education​\n",
      "9.​ Monitor and Evaluate Outcomes: As policies roll out, set up mechanisms to evaluate\n",
      "-------------------------------------\n",
      "their impact. Use both quantitative metrics (e.g., improvement in skill competencies,\n",
      "employment rates after retraining, etc.) and qualitative feedback (student and teacher\n",
      "surveys about the new methods). This data-driven approach will allow tweaking policies\n",
      "in response to what works or doesn’t – essentially applying the AI mindset of iteration\n",
      "and learning to policymaking itself.\n",
      "-------------------------------------\n",
      "By enacting such policies, governments can provide a supportive framework within which\n",
      "schools, universities, and other educational organizations can innovate and adapt. It’s about\n",
      "aligning incentives and resources with the future we’re trying to create: one where education\n",
      "empowers every individual to thrive alongside intelligent machines, and no one is left behind in\n",
      "the AI revolution.\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "Artificial intelligence is advancing at an unprecedented pace, ushering in profound changes to\n",
      "the nature of work and human life. Education sits at the forefront of this change – both as a safeguard against disruption and as a catalyst for human flourishing in the age of AI. Today, AI is\n",
      "mostly narrow (focused on specific tasks), but it’s quickly becoming more capable. Experts anticipate that within the next decade we could see Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) – AI\n",
      "that matches human cognitive abilities across diverse tasks – and beyond that, Artificial Superintelligence (ASI), an intelligence far surpassing human in virtually every domain​.\n",
      "Each stage of this evolution presents new challenges and opportunities for learners:\n",
      "==========================\n",
      "Phase 1 (2025-2028): AI Agents and Job Adaptation – AI consists of smart agents and\n",
      "automation tools that assist humans and take over routine jobs. Education’s priority is helping people adapt skills and find employment in an AI-disrupted economy.\n",
      "●​ Phase 2 (2028-2033): AGI and Purpose-Driven Learning – With the advent of AGI, most traditional jobs (white-collar and blue-collar alike) can be handled by machines.\n",
      "Humans shift into roles of directing purpose and overseeing AI, making personal growth\n",
      "and purpose-driven education essential. ●​ Phase 3 (Beyond 2033): ASI and Transcendence – ASI emerges with god-like\n",
      "intelligence, fundamentally altering human existence. Education must prepare individuals\n",
      "==========================\n",
      "for existential choices (such as whether to merge with AI or co-exist alongside it) and\n",
      "help them navigate a transformed reality.\n",
      "​ Across these phases, key themes emerge: the growing importance of experiential and\n",
      "immersive learning methods, the need to support psychological and emotional well-being\n",
      "during transitions, the urgency for policies that keep education relevant, practical strategies for implementation, and the potential of AI-driven educational assistants (like EON Reality) to\n",
      "foster curiosity and integrate AI into learning. In the sections that follow, we delve into each phase and theme in detail, providing research-backed insights and recommendations.\n",
      "==========================\n",
      "Phase 1 (2025-2028): AI Agents and Job Adaptation\n",
      "In the mid-2020s, AI is primarily characterized by intelligent agents and automation systems that perform specific tasks and assist humans. Examples include AI chatbots in customer service,\n",
      "algorithms that automate administrative work, and robots handling repetitive manufacturing or logistics tasks. This phase does not yet feature truly general AI, but the impact on jobs is\n",
      "significant. AI agents are increasingly capable of handling routine, rule-based, and even some complex tasks, leading to both job displacement in certain sectors and the creation of new\n",
      "opportunities in others.\n",
      "==========================\n",
      "Automation of Routine Jobs and New Skill Demands\n",
      "By 2025, an estimated ^50% of all employees will require reskilling^ due to AI and automation’s impact on job roles​. Entire categories of work – from data entry and bookkeeping to basic\n",
      "diagnostics and assembly line work – are being automated. For instance, advances in robotics and software mean tasks once done by assistants or factory workers can be done faster and more\n",
      "cheaply by AI-driven systems. One analysis by the World Economic Forum found that between 2025 and 2030, about 8% of current jobs (around 92 million roles) could be displaced by\n",
      "structural labor market changes, even as new jobs emerge​. Crucially, the fastest-growing roles\n",
      "==========================\n",
      "will demand digital and technical skills (like AI, big data, cybersecurity) as well as human\n",
      "skills that AI cannot easily replicate (creative thinking, resilience, flexibility, leadership, etc.)​ Education’s role in this context is to equip individuals with the skills needed in an\n",
      "AI-augmented workforce. That means two things: (1) teaching people to work effectively with AI tools (for example, using AI-driven data analysis software in finance or collaborating\n",
      "with AI assistants in project management), and (2) training people in areas where human expertise will remain essential. Notably, the skills predicted to be most in demand are those that\n",
      "complement AI, such as advanced analytical thinking, creativity, empathy, leadership, and other\n",
      "forms of social intelligence​\n",
      "==========================\n",
      "However, the content of many current educational curricula does not yet reflect this rapid shift.\n",
      "Traditional education has emphasized knowledge acquisition and routine cognitive skills – the\n",
      "very things AI is quickly mastering. A critical change is needed: schools and training programs must focus more on “learning how to learn,” adaptability, and critical thinking than on\n",
      "memorizing facts. In fact, experts note that the top skills for 2025 center on thinking and self-management, rather than traditional subject-matter expertise​\n",
      "By one estimate, if the global workforce were 100 people, 59 would need training by 2030, and\n",
      "==========================\n",
      "11 might not get the reskilling they need – leaving their jobs at risk​\n",
      "In response, major initiatives like the World Economic Forum’s Reskilling Revolution aim to empower 1 billion people with education and skills by 2030, reflecting the massive scale of\n",
      "training required​. Employers themselves recognize this urgency: 63% of employers in one survey cited skill gaps as the biggest barrier to adopting new technologies​ Adapting Education for Skill Transitions\n",
      "To meet these challenges, education systems in Phase 1 must pivot to facilitate rapid skill\n",
      "adaptation and job transitions. Key strategies include:\n",
      "==========================\n",
      "Curriculum updates: Schools (from K-12 through higher education) should integrate\n",
      "emerging fields (like AI literacy, data science, and robotics) into the curriculum. Basic coding, understanding how AI works, and data literacy should become as fundamental as\n",
      "reading and math. For example, Finland introduced a free online AI course (“Elements of AI”) to educate citizens on AI basics, aiming to train 1% of its population in AI skills – a\n",
      "model that other countries are emulating to raise baseline AI knowledge across the\n",
      "workforce. Emphasis on STEM and beyond: A strong foundation in science, technology,\n",
      "engineering, and math (STEM) is important, but equally important are creative arts and\n",
      "==========================\n",
      "humanities that foster creativity, ethics, and critical thinking. Education for an AI world\n",
      "is not purely technical; it must nurture the uniquely human capacities that automation\n",
      "cannot replace.\n",
      "==========================\n",
      "●​ Lifelong learning infrastructure: Governments and institutions should make it easier\n",
      "for workers to re-skill and up-skill throughout their careers. This can involve mid-career training programs, online learning platforms, micro-credential programs, and financial\n",
      "support for continuing education. The reality is that many workers will need to change\n",
      "careers or at least significantly update their skills as automation progresses. For instance, AT&T famously launched extensive reskilling programs to help its legacy employees\n",
      "learn new tech skills rather than face layoffs​. Career counseling and guidance: Schools and job centers need to prepare students not\n",
      "for one job, but for a journey of multiple career shifts. Teaching career adaptability –\n",
      "==========================\n",
      "how to pivot when an industry changes – is a crucial part of modern education. This\n",
      "might include scenario planning exercises where students research how automation could\n",
      "affect a field they’re interested in and identify alternative paths. ●​ Public-private partnerships: Collaboration between educators, industry, and\n",
      "government can ensure training aligns with market needs. For example, companies can\n",
      "partner with community colleges to create fast-track programs for in-demand roles (such as AI system technicians or drone maintenance specialists). These partnerships can keep\n",
      "curricula up-to-date with technological advances and provide learners with hands-on\n",
      "experience. A case study highlighting adaptation is Walmart’s approach to employee training. The retail\n",
      "giant faced new technologies in stores and turned to immersive learning to upskill workers at\n",
      "==========================\n",
      "scale. Using virtual reality (VR) training modules in their “Walmart Academy,” the company\n",
      "prepared employees for challenging scenarios like holiday rushes. The results were striking: employees who trained with VR reported 30% higher satisfaction with the training,\n",
      "performed better on post-training tests 70% of the time, and retained 10-15% more knowledge compared to those who underwent traditional training​ Moreover, tasks that normally took 90\n",
      "minutes in a classroom could be learned in just 20 minutes via VR simulation, a 96% reduction in training time – saving the company millions in productivity​ This example shows how\n",
      "embracing new educational technology can dramatically improve skill acquisition for the\n",
      "workforce.\n",
      "==========================\n",
      "Addressing Workforce Anxiety and Fear of Automation\n",
      "As AI reshapes jobs, workforce anxiety has become a prevalent challenge. Many people worry: “Will my job be next to go?” This fear of becoming obsolete (FOBO) is a real psychological\n",
      "phenomenon. Surveys in the U.S. found that over one-fifth of workers fear that technology will make their jobs obsolete​\n",
      ". Notably, this fear has grown as AI capabilities (like generative AI) have entered the mainstream – rising from about 15% of workers in 2017 to 22% by 2023 who express this concern​\n",
      "4\n",
      "==========================\n",
      "news.gallup.com\n",
      ". Even highly educated workers, who once felt immune, are now nearly as worried as those\n",
      "without college degrees​.\n",
      "==========================\n",
      "Education systems have a responsibility not only to re-skill workers but also to alleviate this\n",
      "anxiety through information and guidance. Several approaches can help:\n",
      "●​ Transparency about change: Schools and training programs should openly discuss how\n",
      "industries are evolving with AI, so people can anticipate changes rather than be\n",
      "blindsided. This includes highlighting which jobs are likely to be impacted and which new jobs are growing (e.g., the rise of roles such as AI model trainers, ethicists, or\n",
      "maintenance technicians for automated systems). The World Economic Forum notes that while many jobs will be disrupted, AI is expected to create as many jobs as it displaces\n",
      "overall – but those new jobs will require different skills and continuous learning​\n",
      "Knowing this can replace panic with purpose: if individuals see that new opportunities\n",
      "==========================\n",
      "exist and can be prepared for, they feel more in control.\n",
      "==========================\n",
      "Incorporating resilience and mindset training: Adapting to rapid change is stressful.\n",
      "Education can integrate social-emotional learning components that build resilience,\n",
      "adaptability, and a growth mindset. This might involve teaching stress management techniques, fostering a mindset that views change as an opportunity to grow (rather than a\n",
      "threat), and normalizing the idea of multiple careers in one’s lifetime. ●​ Career coaching and mentorship: Personal mentorship can be extremely reassuring\n",
      "during career transitions. A mentor (such as a teacher, career counselor, or industry\n",
      "expert) can help an individual navigate options and build confidence. Research shows that mentoring is associated with a wide range of positive outcomes – from better\n",
      "academic achievement to improved career prospects and life satisfaction​\n",
      "==========================\n",
      "Public education campaigns: Governments and community organizations can run\n",
      "campaigns or workshops to educate the broader public about AI and jobs. For example,\n",
      "offering free short courses on “AI for Beginners” or hosting community talks can demystify AI. Finland’s aforementioned Elements of AI online course (which attracted\n",
      "hundreds of thousands of learners globally) is a great example of empowering citizens with knowledge to reduce fear. When people understand what AI can and cannot do, they\n",
      "are less likely to have vague fears and more likely to identify concrete steps for their\n",
      "career.\n",
      "==========================\n",
      "●​ Policy safety nets: While not purely an educational measure, having policies like\n",
      "unemployment benefits, scholarships for retraining, or even discussions of Universal Basic Income (UBI) can reduce panic. If people know there’s societal support while they\n",
      "retrain, the prospect of job automation is less frightening. Education programs should\n",
      "advertise and guide learners toward these support resources when relevant.\n",
      "==========================\n",
      "Ultimately, Phase 1 education is about enabling humans to thrive alongside AI agents. By\n",
      "focusing on adaptable skills, leveraging immersive training, and addressing psychological needs, educational institutions can turn the challenge of automation into an opportunity. Instead of\n",
      "viewing AI as a threat, learners can be taught to see AI as a tool – one that, if mastered, can boost their productivity and open doors to new careers. The end goal is a workforce prepared for the\n",
      "shifting landscape, armed with both the hard skills (like technical know-how) and the soft skills (like creativity and emotional intelligence) to secure meaningful employment in an AI-enhanced\n",
      "economy.\n",
      "==========================\n",
      "Phase 2 (2028-2033): Artificial General Intelligence\n",
      "and Purpose-Driven Learning\n",
      "By the late 2020s and early 2030s, we enter a phase where AI could reach or approach Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) – a level of machine intelligence equivalent to human intelligence\n",
      "across the full range of cognitive tasks. While timelines are debated, some AI experts give significant probability to human-level AI emerging around this period. For instance, one AI\n",
      "research leader estimated a 50% chance of AGI by 2030​, and forecasting platforms like Metaculus have a median prediction around 2031 for the first general AI system​. Whether AGI\n",
      "arrives exactly in 2030 or a few years later, the scenario is that in this phase AI can perform\n",
      "==========================\n",
      "nearly all jobs that humans can – often faster, cheaper, and with fewer errors. This marks a\n",
      "dramatic shift: AI is no longer just augmenting human work; in many cases, it can replace\n",
      "human work entirely. The End of “Jobs” as We Know Them?\n",
      "If AGI becomes a reality, most traditional white-collar and blue-collar jobs could be handled by machines. An AGI could potentially write software, diagnose illnesses, draft legal contracts,\n",
      "drive vehicles, teach classes, create art, and do scientific research – essentially encompassing both routine manual labor and complex knowledge work. In such a world, the economic role of\n",
      "humans changes profoundly. We move from being workers to being, in essence, directors and\n",
      "==========================\n",
      "purpose definers. Instead of asking “What job will I do?”, individuals may ask “What purpose\n",
      "do I want to pursue, now that I’m not required to work to survive?” To be clear, this doesn’t necessarily mean mass unemployment with nothing to do. It means the\n",
      "work available to humans transitions to new forms. A commonly cited idea is that humans will\n",
      "==========================\n",
      "take on roles that involve guiding AI – sometimes described as roles like “AI trainers,\n",
      "explainers, or sustainers”​\n",
      "For example, humans might: Train AIs by providing feedback or higher-level goals (shaping what the AGI focuses on\n",
      "or what values it follows).\n",
      "●​ Explain AIs by interpreting AI decisions to other humans, ensuring transparency and trust (especially if AI reasoning is complex).\n",
      "●​ Sustain AIs by monitoring systems, handling exceptions, and maintaining ethical\n",
      "standards (preventing harm or misuse). These roles align with the idea of humans as “purpose directors and orchestrators.” We set the\n",
      "vision, values, and objectives, and the AGI systems execute the tasks to fulfill those directives.\n",
      "==========================\n",
      "In a company setting, for instance, human leaders might decide the company’s strategy and\n",
      "desired outcomes, and AIs could generate and implement solutions to achieve those outcomes. In governance, humans might collectively decide on societal goals (like ending hunger or\n",
      "addressing climate change), and AIs could design and run initiatives to meet those goals. This shift raises an important question: If machines do nearly all the work, what is the\n",
      "purpose of human lives, and how do we find meaning? Throughout history, work has been a\n",
      "==========================\n",
      "primary source of purpose and identity for many people. We often define ourselves by our\n",
      "professions. Suddenly being “freed” from work sounds utopian, but it can easily become dystopian if people feel aimless or useless. Yuval Noah Harari has warned of the rise of a\n",
      "“useless class” – people who feel economically irrelevant if we don’t create new meaningful roles in the age of AI. The emotional toll of losing one’s traditional work role can be immense.\n",
      "Research on unemployed individuals shows that over two-thirds experience identity-related struggles after losing their jobs, and nearly half say this identity crisis is the hardest part –\n",
      "often causing depression and anxiety.\n",
      "==========================\n",
      "Education’s New Mission: Awakening Purpose and Curiosity\n",
      "In Phase 2, education must undergo a paradigm shift. The goal is no longer to train people for specific jobs (since AGI can perform most job-tasks), but rather to help people discover their\n",
      "passions, develop their unique talents, and craft their own purpose. In other words, education moves from imparting content to inspiring vision. Key aspects of this transformed\n",
      "education include: Cultivating Curiosity and Passion: Schools and universities should nurture the intrinsic\n",
      "curiosity that every child has – the drive to ask questions, explore, and tinker. In the age\n",

      "of AGI, a curious mindset is gold. Why? Because when routine learning is handled by AI\n",
      "tutors and any factual question can be answered by an AI, the value shifts to asking the right questions and imagining new possibilities. Education can encourage students to\n",
      "pursue the questions that fascinate them, even if they don’t have immediate “market\n",
      "value.” This could mean more open-ended exploration in the curriculum: science classes focused on student-led experiments, literature classes encouraging creative writing and\n",
